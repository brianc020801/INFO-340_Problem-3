# Problem: Cut-Out Art

In this exercise, you'll practice writing CSS rules and using different selectors to style specific elements. By applying these rules to an existing HTML structure (technically SVG), you'll "cut out" and reveal a picture!

To complete the exercise, add rules to the included `css/style.css` file that apply the styling notes listed in the included `index.html` file. (That is: open up the HTML file and look at the comments for what style each element should have. Then write a rule that applies that style to that element). For this exercise, you must **not** modify the HTML file: try to come up with selectors based only on the provided structure!

(The fun of the exercise is watching the picture emerge as you work, but if you want to check your solution at the end, you can find an image of what it should look like in the provided `img/` folder).
